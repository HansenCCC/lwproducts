My favorite season£®Œ“◊Óœ≤ª∂µƒºæΩ⁄£©Among the four seasons, my favorite season is winter. It lasts from December to February. Although winter means cold weather, I love it all the same.

Every time it snows, I will remember an old saying, "When winter comes, can spring be far away?°± We can wear warm clothes and go outside to make snowmen. It is a good season for skating. Therefore, I like winter best.

Honesty is the best policy we can take.

Dear classmates,      I°Øm Li Hua. After the discussion we found that 60% of the students think they should take all kinds of exercise every day but not spend too much time, such as doing morning exercise, playing table tennis and basketball. They think exercise builds body and reduce the chance of disease. Sports also let them have a good rest so that their study will be more effective. On the other hand 40% students believe taking exercise is tiring and it°Øs a waste of time. They say that after having sports they are too excited for a long time to focus on their lessons. And it°Øs possible to get hurt during exercise.  In short, it°Øs good to exercise everyday, but overdoing it will bring harm to us.
Television/About Television£®µÁ ”£©Television has its good as well as bad sides. It makes us informed of daily news, lets us know the outside world, provides lessons for learners, and it has brought joy and interest into people°Øs lives. Unfortunately, some television programs have been extremely harmful to the young. Violent movies are shown on TV programs. Children regard the murders as heroes or models, so they imitate. Therefore there happened many murders or shooting cases in American campuses. What a big harm.
So young people should learn to get ride of the bad influences of TV and learn to make use of the advantages that TV brings us.
Advantages and Disadvantages of the Mobile Phone£® ÷ª˙µƒ¿˚”Î±◊£©/My Opinion on Cell Phones  Like everything else, mobile phones have both favorable and unfavorable aspects.First, it's useful. As a wireless mobile telephone, it's easy and handy to call wherever one goes and call the one however far away he is. Second, it's convenient. Whenever one meets trouble or something urgent, one can make a call immediately.However, the mobile phone also has many disadvantages. First, it's expensive to buy and costly to pay the bills. Second, it's also easy to lose and costly to get it repaired. Third, it's alleged the microwaves in it might do harm to people's health.I believe its advantages will far outweigh disadvantages soon.

Changes in My life£®Œ“…˙ªÓµƒ±‰ªØ£©There have been many changes in my life. With the development of the economy, my life is better off.

For housing, I moved from a cramped and gloomy room to a big and bright flat. For getting around, I rode an old bike on my way to work a year ago. At present, I drive my private car to travel. I believe my life will become better in the near future.

However, others think that it can bring students and the society closer and is good for cultural exchange between people. In my opinion, several factors should be considered before opening the campuses to tourists. First, I suggest we should choose the universities with long history and beautiful campuses. Second, the campus should only be open to tourists on weekends or during holidays.

Failure is the mother of success£® ß∞‹ «≥…π¶÷Æƒ∏£©All of us experience failure every now and then. Although some people will avoid failure at all costs, some people welcome it. Failure can be a good teacher. It always teaches us to be better the second time around. As they say, "The more you try, the more you'll succeed." There is some wisdom to be learned from failure. If we can learn to turn a failure to our advantage, we will have learned another secret to success. Failure is the mother of success and success that comes after failure is so sweet.
Friendship£®”—“Í£©Friendship is a kind of human relations. It is a human instinct to make friends. When in trouble, we need friends to offer us help, support and encouragement. With success achieved, we also need friends to share our joys. Friendship is one of the greatest pleasures that we can enjoy. It implies loyalty, cordiality, sympathy, affection, and readiness to help. In short, when we have established friendship, we ought to cherish and treasure it. Only thus, can we develop real friendship and keep the sacred lamp of friendship burning all our life.
How to use a dictionary£®»Á∫Œ π”√◊÷µ‰£©When you are reading something in English, you may often come across a new word. What's the best way to know it? We should choose a good English-Chinese dictionary. It tells us the meaning of the English words in Chinese. When you meet a new word, don't use the dictionary at once. Try your best to think about what it means before you look it up in the dictionary. If you can't guess the meaning, look it up in the dictionary. If you use the dictionary as often as possible in your English learning, it will become your good friend.
Is stress a bad thing?£®—π¡¶ «ªµ ¬¬£ø£©Quite a number of men and women choose to do things less competitive. They are afraid that the stress of work will rob them of joy and happiness.In fact, however, stress isn°Øt the bad thing it is often supposed to be. Above all, unless it gets out of control, a certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and challenge. Furthermore, people under stress tend to express their full range of potential and to achieve their own personal worth. Stress is a natural part of everyday life and there is no way to avoid it. What we can do is to learn to deal with it rather than to escape from it.

My Favorite course£®Œ“◊Óœ≤ª∂µƒøŒ≥Ã£¨–Ë“™º”…œªÆœﬂµƒ“ªæ‰£©/ The course I like best of the long-distance education (Œ“◊Óœ≤ª∂µƒ‘∂≥ÃΩÃ”˝øŒ≥Ã£¨≤ª–Ë“™º”ªÆœﬂ“ªæ‰)Among all the courses I have taken in TV University, I like English courses best. The reasons are as follows.Firstly, there are many online courses and sources, which enables me to study anywhere and anytime I like. I can download many useful materials from the website and practice them all the time. Secondly, English is one of the most useful languages in the world. My job is also related to English. Therefore, English learning helps me to deal with my job better. Last but not least, our school has many good English teachers, who are willing to help us whenever we meet with difficulties.    In short, English is my favorite course, but I also have to work hard to learn other courses.
My favorite means of transportation£®Œ“◊Óœ≤ª∂µƒΩªÕ®∑Ω Ω£©/ Which means of transportation do you prefer?£®ƒ„◊Óœ≤ª∂ƒƒ“ª÷÷ΩªÕ®∑Ω Ω£ø£©There are so many means of transportation, such as bus, taxi, subway.Bus is cheap but a little slow. Every time I should go out early to wait for some time, and it takes long time to get to the destination. Taxi is fast but a little expensive. It costs much money to get to the destination. My favorite means of transportation is subway. Subway is cheap, convenient and not so expensive. It saves my money as well as my time. So my favorite means of transportation is subway.
My favorite piece of music£®Œ“◊Óœ≤ª∂µƒ“Ù¿÷£©All of us have some of favorite songs. Most of the Chinese people like Chinese songs. But I think the English songs are wonderful as well.Yesterday Once More is my favorite song. It is such a beautiful song that people all over the world know it. The rhythm of Yesterday Once More is very soothing and touching. The lyrics are also beautiful which tells people the good old days. When I listen to this song, I seem to be back to my happy childhood. I love the singers°Ø voices very much.
My Favorite TV program◊Ó∞ÆµƒµÁ ”Ω⁄ƒøThe News Report has always been my favorite TV program. The News Report contains a large amount of information ranging from the international political situation to the latest football game. And the most important character is its fast pace. Because of this fast pace, news programs can contain much information in a short time. In my opinion, the News Report is more than a TV program. It is a way of communication. From this program, people can know and understand world affairs. I especially appreciate this benefit of watching the news.
My Plan for the Spring Festival  (Œ“µƒ¥∫Ω⁄º∆ªÆ)Spring festival is the most important festival for Chinese people. Many people will prepare many things for the spring festival. Now this is my plan for the spring festival. The first, I will visit my friends and my relatives. The second, I will make a big snow man with my daughter and my wife. The third, I will stay with my parents, because I have no more time to stay with them at peacetime. This is my plan for the spring festival. I hope all of you have a good time in the spring festival.
My Plan for the National Day Holiday£®π˙«ÏºŸ∆⁄º∆ªÆ£©National Holiday is coming. There are altogether 7 days, so I need to plan it in advance. Firstly, I plan to have a good rest for the first 2 days when I can have a good sleep and don°Øt worry to get up late, and then do a good cleaning of the home. Secondly, I would go to Zhouzhuang, a traditional southern town with my husband for a 2 days°Ø trip. I hope I like it. Thirdly, I would fly to Beijing to attend my classmate°Øs wedding. These above are my plans for the National Holiday.
My view on luck£®πÿ”⁄‘À∆¯£©Nowadays many people believe in luck. They think luck can bring them everything. If they have good luck, they will be successful without hard work. But this is a wrong idea. As we all know, good luck does not come alone. Luck goes hand in hand with hard work. When a good chance comes to you, but you don°Øt work hard to complete the task, then you can°Øt grasp the chance, so good luck passes you by and leaves you. Therefore, people should work hard instead of depending on luck completely.
Newspapers¬€±®÷ΩI read newspapers every day. As a student, I have no time to watch news programs on TV. Besides, watching television takes up a lot of time. So reading the newspaper becomes the only way for me to learn about what's happening around the world.There is an old Chinese saying, "A scholar need not leave his home to know what°Øs going on in the world." Thus, reading the newspaper is a must for those who wish to keep up with the times.
On money£®πÿ”⁄Ω«Æ£©/ Money is not everything£®Ω«Æ≤ª «ÕÚƒ‹µƒ£©/Can Money Buy Happiness?A famous saying goes that °∞money is a good servant but a bad master.°± Should we become its masters or its slaves? I think we should be the masters of money and never be controlled by money. As we all know, money is necessary for a happy life, for we need money to make a living in the society. But money is not equal to happiness and a lot of rich people live a miserable life. Money is important, but it is not everything. We should think of money in a correct way and never do anything illegal in order to get money.
On TV Ads£®¬€µÁ ”π„∏Ê£©/My view on the Negative Effects of Some Advertisements£®π„∏Êµƒ∏∫√Ê”∞œÏ£©Nowadays there are a lot of false advertisements in society. They have caused much harm to society. Generally, their negative effects can be listed as follows.First, they exaggerate the functions of the goods they advertise and mislead consumers. Second, some advertisements contain bad contents and bring about spiritual pollution. Third, they seriously damage the credit of businesses because the shops which sell those goods will be distrusted by consumers. In conclusion, false advertisements must be got rid of in our society.
Parents are the best teachers£®∏∏ƒ∏ «◊Ó∫√µƒ¿œ ¶£©Parents are the best teachers. Firstly, parents stay with children every day. Children will regard them as examples and learn from them. If the parents are polite, the children will be polite. Secondly, parents influence children with their words and behaviors. If parents always are nice to others and say good words about others, their children will also be kind to other children. If parents are good to old people, when the parents are getting older, the children will be good to them too. To sum up, from what has been discussed above we can draw the conclusion that parents are our best parents.
Plant more trees£®÷÷∏¸∂‡µƒ ˜£©April is the best time for green. Everything turns back to life in the warm weather and is enjoying the energy of a new life. Trees are more and more important to the earth. Planting trees is the basic thing to provide a green and healthy environment. Trees, as they are green in color, can make a city or place look more beautiful. It is also valuable in avoiding noises, sandstorms and deserts. It can bring us back a beautiful earth.So, everyone, if you want to make the air clean, please try your best to protect the environment and plant more trees.
Talking About Yourself£®Ã∏Ã∏ƒ„◊‘º∫£©My name is Li Hua. I was born and brought up in Shanghai. I am 25 years old. I live with my parents in a flat in the northern part of the city. I work as a salesperson in a foreign trade company. My job is not so easy as I have to write e-mails and talk with my clients all the time. Sometimes I have to go on a business trip. I also go to TV University to study English because I think English is quite helpful to my work. During my spare time, I°Ød like to play basketball and go swimming with some of my friends.

English is really very hard for me, as it is so different from Chinese. First, I can°Øt remember a lot of new words. Second, I°Øm weak in grammar. Third, my listening is poor. Fourth, I can°Øt speak English very well, and I don°Øt have any chance to talk with foreigners. With so many difficulties, I am afraid of learning English and hate learning this course very much.
The way to success£®≥…π¶µƒ∑Ω∑®£©As we all know, not all people can make success in their lives. Most people will meet with failures on the way to success. Why do some people get successful in their lives? I think there are three reasons. Firstly, they have strong willpower. Once they decide to do something, they will never give up. Secondly, they work hard. Once they set up a goal, they will work hard to achieve it. Thirdly, they never easily quit. They always stick to their aims.I believe that where there is a will there is a way, and that success belongs to those who can make constant efforts.
Water PollutionÀÆŒ€»æ/Water and Life ÀÆ”Î…˙ªÓEverybody knows that water pollution is a serious problem in the world. Lots of rubbish or chemical pollutants have been thrown in the rivers, lakes and seas. Many of them are getting dirtier and dirtier. Fish have died in the water, and people get sick after drinking polluted water. My grandfather says, when he was very little, the water in the river was very clean. He often swam in the river with his friends. But now we can°Øt see such clean rivers. Let°Øs protect the water from pollution, because we can°Øt live without water. The water is really important to us all.
